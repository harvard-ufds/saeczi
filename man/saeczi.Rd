\usage{
saeczi(
  samp_dat,
  pop_dat,
  lin_formula,
  log_formula = lin_formula,
  domain_level,
  B = 100,
  mse_est = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{samp_dat}{A dataframe with domains, predictor variables, and the response variable of a sample}

\item{pop_dat}{A dataframe with domains and predictor variables of a population}

\item{lin_formula}{model formula for the linear regression model}

\item{log_formula}{model formula for the logistic regression model}

\item{domain_level}{A string of the column name in the dataframes that reflect the domain level}

\item{B}{An integer of the number of reps desired for the bootstrap}

\item{mse_est}{A boolean that specifies if the user}

\item{parallel}{Compute MSE estimation in parallel}
}
\description{
Calculate the domain predictions using the zero-inflation estimator, and outputs
those domain-level predictions, in the form of a dataframe. It contains
the estimates for each domain, as well as the mean squared error estimates should
the user choose. The output of the function is a list, with the first item being
said dataframe, and the second being the R squared value of the model.
}
\details{
The arguments `lin_formula`, and `log_formula`
can be unquoted or quoted. The function can handle both forms.

The two datasets (pop_dat and samp_dat) must have the same column names for the domain level,
as well as the predictor variables for the function to work.
